Dossier keeps your career history in one profile and turns it into a clean resume. For every job you apply to, it reads the posting, shows how you match, and drafts a tailored resume and cover letter that only use facts from your profile. You refine them in a chat, download them as PDFs and track each application from draft to offer.

It's for one person on a local computer or small server: one password, your data in your own native PostgreSQL database (no Docker required), a modern Vite + React 19 single-page frontend with an Express API backend, and an AI model of your choice. That can be a local model through Ollama or LM Studio, so your profile and documents stay on your own hardware, or a hosted one (any OpenAI-compatible API, Anthropic or Mistral), which then receives what it writes from. [Privacy](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Privacy) says what goes where.

**Get started:** [run it on your computer](#run-it-on-your-computer) in a few minutes, or [self-host it](#self-hosting) on a server.

## Demo

![Dossier in use: the dashboard, dragging a card on the board, a new application from a pasted posting, refining the tailored resume in the chat, the cover letter, and switching resume themes](.github/images/demo.gif)

<sub>Recorded with the demo data (Jane Doe is made up) and a stand-in AI server that answers at once, played at 1.2× speed. With a real model, reading a posting and writing the documents takes from a few seconds to a few minutes.</sub>

## Features

- **Profile:** basics, skills and languages, experience, projects, education and references, in the order you choose, with a strength meter. Projects (side, open-source, course or thesis work) show what you can do where your job titles don't yet. Start it from an existing resume (PDF, Word or Markdown) if you like.
- **Base resume:** twelve themes and a theme builder, previewed live and printed to PDF on the server. Duplicate themes, or share them as files.
- **Find jobs:** search postings near your city, or anywhere you choose, through JSearch (LinkedIn, Indeed and more), Adzuna or Germany's Bundesagentur für Arbeit. Save the good ones, dismiss the rest, score any of them against your profile, and start an application from a posting with one click.
- **Job agent (optional):** once a day it runs one search for you, skips what you've seen, scores the new postings against your profile and keeps the best on the Agent screen, with its reasons. It can prepare tailored drafts too, which wait for your review. It never sends or applies.
- **New application:** paste a posting; Dossier pulls out the details and requirements, matches them against your profile, and writes a tailored resume and cover letter in the tone you pick.
- **Never invents experience:** drafts only use facts from your profile. What the posting asks for and your profile doesn't have is shown as a gap, not made up.
- **Refine:** ask for changes in a chat, edit or regenerate any part (every part of the cover letter too: sender, date, recipient, greeting and sign-off, written in the letter's language), undo AI changes or go back to any earlier version, keep private notes.
- **Send:** an email to go with each application, to whoever the posting says to send it to, ready to copy or open in your mail app, with the resume and cover letter PDFs to attach. Edit, rewrite or refine it like the documents.
- **Gmail and Calendar (optional):** connect your Google account to send an application from your own address with its PDFs attached, see employers' replies next to each application, have the AI read what they ask and draft your answer from your profile, offer interview times you're free, and see your month and the week ahead on the dashboard, with interviews kept in step with Google Calendar both ways. Nothing is sent without your confirmation. Set it up by entering your Google OAuth client in Settings → Google, or with `DOSSIER_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `DOSSIER_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (see [Connecting Gmail and Calendar](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Connecting-Gmail-and-Calendar)).
- **Track:** a board and a table of every application, and a dashboard with your funnel (last 30 days, 90 days or all time), a week-by-week chart, what's worth a look next, upcoming interviews included, and a calendar.
- **Your data:** export and import everything as one file, nightly backups, and Delete everything.

## Run it on your computer

Running Dossier requires **Node.js 22+**, **Yarn 4** (via Corepack), and a native **PostgreSQL 16+** installation. Docker is not required.

### 1. PostgreSQL Setup

Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running natively on port 5432:

```sql
-- Connect via psql and create the database:
CREATE DATABASE dossier;
\c dossier
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext;
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Copy the example environment file and generate the required secrets:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Generate a random secret (at least 32 characters) for `DOSSIER_SECRET`:
```bash
# On Linux/macOS:
openssl rand -base64 32

# On Windows PowerShell:
-join ((65..90) + (97..122) + (48..57) | Get-Random -Count 32 | ForEach-Object {[char]$_})
```

Generate your password hash:
```bash
corepack yarn hash-password
```
Enter your password twice. Copy the resulting `argon2id:...` string into `.env` as `DOSSIER_PASSWORD`.

Update `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to match your local PostgreSQL credentials:
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:your_password@localhost:5432/dossier"
```

### 3. Deploy Migrations and Seed Built-ins

```bash
corepack yarn install
corepack yarn prisma migrate deploy
corepack yarn prisma db seed
```

*(Optional)* To populate Jane Doe's demo profile and sample applications:
```bash
corepack yarn prisma db seed -- --demo
```

### 4. Start the Application

To start in development mode with hot-reloading:
```bash
corepack yarn dev
```

To build and run in production mode:
```bash
corepack yarn build
corepack yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), sign in with your password, and pick an AI model in **Settings → AI provider**.

## Self-hosting

Dossier can be deployed natively on any Linux server, VPS, or cloud VM with Node.js and PostgreSQL. Use a reverse proxy such as Caddy or Nginx to terminate HTTPS and forward requests to `http://localhost:3000`. Give the server at least 2 vCPUs and 2 GB of memory.

## Documentation

The [wiki](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki) has what comes after installing:

- [Choosing an AI provider](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Choosing-an-AI-provider): a hosted model, or a local one with Ollama or LM Studio.
- [Choosing a job source](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Choosing-a-job-source): JSearch, Adzuna or the Bundesagentur für Arbeit, and the job agent.
- [Connecting Gmail and Calendar](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Connecting-Gmail-and-Calendar): your own Google OAuth client, step by step.
- [Backups and restore](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Backups-and-restore): exports, nightly backups and database dumps.
- <a name="upgrading"></a>[Upgrading](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Upgrading) to a new version.
- [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Troubleshooting): what the common errors mean, and what to do about them.
- [Privacy](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Privacy): what stays on your server and what leaves it. [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) has the details.
- [Environment variables](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Environment-variables): every setting the server reads.

## Known limitations

- **Desktop only:** made for a laptop or desktop browser, not for phones.
- **Single user:** one password and one profile; there are no accounts.
- **English interface:** the app itself is in English. Documents can be written in other languages.
- **One instance:** run a single copy of the app per database. The nightly backups, the AI job queue and the PDF browser live inside the app's process.

## Performance and sizing

- **PDFs:** the base resume renders in about 0.25 s, or 1 s when Chromium starts. Chromium is managed directly via Playwright in the Node process.
- **Screens:** with ten times the demo data (90 applications), the dashboard and the applications list answer in 20–90 ms.
- **Interactions:** changing statuses, moving cards, editing documents respond within 30 ms.
